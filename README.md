# Scheduling-Algorithms
Scheduling algorithms schedule processes on the processor in an efficient and effective manner. This scheduling is done by a Process Scheduler. It maximizes CPU utilization by increasing throughput.

1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling
2. Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling
4. Priority Scheduling
5. Shortest Remaining Time
6. Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
